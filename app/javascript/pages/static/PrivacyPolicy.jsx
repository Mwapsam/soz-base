credit card information

Take commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, as necessary to provide services or products you have ordered, such as (for example) by providing it to a carrier to deliver products you have ordered.
In the aggregate with other information in such a way so that your identity cannot reasonably be determined (for example, statistical compilations);
as required by law, for example, in response to a subpoena or search warrant to outside auditors who have agreed to keep the information confidential.
